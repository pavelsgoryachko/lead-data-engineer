Redshift Deep Dive

LZO vs ZSTD vs AZ64
Compared to RAW encoding, AZ64 consumed 60–70% less storage, and was 25–30% faster.
Compared to LZO encoding, AZ64 consumed 35% less storage, and was 40% faster.
Compared to ZSTD encoding, AZ64 consumed 5–10% less storage, and was 70% faster.

Bloom Filter - https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/05/amazon-redshift-now-leverages-bloom-filters-to-improve-data-lake-query-performance/
this seems similar to BigQuery’s Dynamic Query Execution, which allows the system to change the number of workers or shuffle partitions at runtime.

Advanced Query Accelerator (AQUA) is a multi-tenant service introduced by Redshift in 2021. It serves as a caching layer for Redshift Managed Storage and an accelerator for complex scans and aggregations.

Redshift Managed Storage (RMS)
RMS is built on the AWS Nitro System, which features high-bandwidth networking. RMS uses high-performance SSD-based local storage as a tier-1 cache. Redshift leverages techniques like automatic fine-grained data eviction and intelligent data prefetching to get the best from local SSD while achieving unlimited scalability of S3.
