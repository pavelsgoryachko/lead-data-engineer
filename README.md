# Path to Lead Data Engineer 
This repo will include:
- Guidance/roadmap to become a Lead/Senior Data Engineer
- Essential materials to get the core fundamental skills and knowledge in the data engineering space
- Experience/insight sharing

Focus will be on data engineering fundamentals like:
- Data structures and algorithms
- Database systems
- Data modeling
- Distributed systems
- Data architectures
- Data processing
- Big Data systems

Goal: get ability to understand the architecture behind data engineering tools and how they work at a core level.


1. Data structures and algorithms
   
1.1. Data structures in Python:
* dictionary
* list
* queue
* set
* Collections: counter, defaultdict

1.2. Overview of Big-O
  time complexity
  space complexity

: Constant time. The running time is independent of the size of the input.
: Linear time. The running time increases linearly with the size of the input.
: Quadratic time. The running time is proportional to the square of the size of the input.
: Logarithmic time. The running time increases logarithmically with the size of the input.
: Exponential time. The running time increases exponentially in the size of the input.

2. Databases
   
2.1. Database systems
Topics: relational algebra; RDBMS vs NoSQL

2.2. Structured Query Language (SQL)
Language used to manage data.

2.3. Database types
- Relational databases (Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySql)
- Column-based (AWS Redshift, Google BigQuery, Cassandra)
- Wide Column (BigTable, HBase)
- Document (MongoDB)
- Graph (Neo4J)
- Key-value (Redis)
- Vector (Chroma, Pinecone)

  
3. Distributed systems
