# Path to Lead Data Engineer 
This repo will include:
- Guidance/roadmap to become a Lead/Senior Data Engineer
- Essential materials to get the core fundamental skills and knowledge in the data engineering space
- Experience/insight sharing

Focus will be on data engineering fundamentals like:
- Data structures and algorithms
- Database systems
- Data modeling
- Distributed computing
- Data architectures
- Data Pipeline design patterns
- Big Data systems
- Version control (Git)
- Containerization (Docker)

Goal: get ability to understand the architecture behind data engineering tools and how they work at a core level.

* dictionary
* list
* queue
* set
* Collections: counter, defaultdict

1.2. Overview of Big-O
